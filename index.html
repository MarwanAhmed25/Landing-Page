        <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>is a general-purpose programming language created by
                Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The 
                language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, 
                and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

        <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. 
                Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. 
                Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write 
                clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.`

        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed 
            to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language 
            intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can 
            run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

                            multi-paradigm. </p>
